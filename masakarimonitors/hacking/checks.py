Guidelines for writing new hacking checks

 - Use only for masakarimonitors specific tests. OpenStack general tests
   should be submitted to the common 'hacking' module.
 - Pick numbers in the range M3xx. Find the current test with
   the highest allocated number and then pick the next value.
 - Keep the test method code in the source file ordered based
   on the M3xx value.
 - List the new rule in the top level HACKING.rst file
 - Add test cases for each new rule to masakarimonitors/tests/unit/
   test_hacking.py
