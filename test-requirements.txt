# Due to the nature of libvirt-python package, in DevStack we use the one
# provided in the distro alongside libvirtd - to ensure the two are compatible,
# and also to avoid the pip error when it tries to uninstall the distro version
# (installed in such a way for Nova in DevStack).
# Do note libvirt-python is used only for instance-oriented monitors, so, e.g.,
# it is not used by any host monitor.
# TODO(yoctozepto): Refactor code to not require libvirt-python for unit tests,
# basically following how it is handled in nova-compute and ceilometer-compute.
libvirt-python>=6.0.0  # LGPLv2+
