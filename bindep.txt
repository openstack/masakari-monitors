# This is a cross-platform list tracking distribution packages needed for install and tests;
# see https://docs.openstack.org/infra/bindep/ for additional information.

# Due to the nature of libvirt-python package, in DevStack we use the one
# provided in the distro alongside libvirtd - to ensure the two are compatible,
# and also to avoid the pip error when it tries to uninstall the distro version
# (installed in such a way for Nova in DevStack).
# Do note libvirt-python is used only for instance-oriented monitors, so, e.g.,
# it is not used by any host monitor.
# TODO(yoctozepto): Refactor code to not require libvirt-python for unit tests,
# basically following how it is handled in nova-compute and ceilometer-compute.
# libvirt-dev and pkg-config are required to compile libvirt-python package.
