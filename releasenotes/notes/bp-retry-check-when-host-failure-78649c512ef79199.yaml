    Support for repeated check of node status in hostmonitor.

    Repeated check is more reliable than single check to determine host
    status, especially when there is network instability in play.

    With this feature, the following config option can be set.

    .. code-block:: ini

      [host]
      monitoring_samples = 3

    The above means 3 checks will be done before the node status is decided.
    The default value is 1 which is backwards compatible.
