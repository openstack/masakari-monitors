    *Note to packagers*: ``libvirt-python`` package is still required by
    instance-oriented monitors. It is available in most distros as
    ``python3-libvirt``.
    It is no longer listed in ``requirements.txt`` so it will not get
    installed when installing ``masakari-monitors`` package from PyPI.
    The change was done to follow how Nova handles this requirement.
    This is to satisfy both libvirtd compatibility and recent pip
    sanity checks.
